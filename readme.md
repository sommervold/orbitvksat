this was first intended to be a small personal website for tracking the competition but that got out of hand quickly
possibly the worst code i've written in a few years, but i guess it works.
run a.py to fetch data from strava, you might need to manually create some files first. good luck on figuring out how.
also copy _strava4_token cookie from strava into token.txt if you want profile pics and full names to be fetched.

run the flask on the app folder to start the website.
